# davidkhuu.com
My personal website.

## Repo name change from davidkhuu.github.io to davidkhuu.com
I changed the name of the repo from `davidkhuu.github.io` to `davidkhuu.com`. My intentions behind this were that I didn't like how each of my projects had the domain `davidkhuu.com`. I only wanted my website to have that domain and anything else relating to it (i.e. about, contact, etc.). I wanted my projects to be under the domain `davidkhuu.github.io` to differentiate them. This was the best solution I could come with. Maybe in the future I'll see if I want to change it back to how it was previously but as for now, this is how I'll have it.
